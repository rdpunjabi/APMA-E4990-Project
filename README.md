# APMA-E4990-Project

<b>APMA E4990 Project Proposal</b>

Image Classification of Dogs Using Convolutional Neural Networks

Team members: Rahi Punjabi, Seung Hwan Lee

Roles: Web Development (Seung), Machine Learning (Rahi)

Tools: Python, Tensor Flow, Flask

Dataset: http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/

Motivation 

We can all distinguish dogs from cats but can you tell the difference between an Afghan Shepherd and a Kerry Beagle? There are 340 recognized breeds of dogs as well as mixed breed dogs, which makes it hard to identify them. We will attempt to apply to the power of machine learning classification to this problem. 

Project description

The aim of this project is to predict the type of dog from a dog image uploaded by the user. We will train a convolutional neural network based on the dog image dataset above and then test it with a set of dog images from Google Images.

Keywords: Convolutional Neural Networks, Image Classification. 

Audience: Our intended users are dog lovers and owners and generally people interested in learning about dog breeds. 

Algorithms: We intend to use Convolutional Neural Networks to process the dog images. We will research and learn how to apply this algorithm through the following tutorials: 

1. http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/
2. http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/lenet.html
3. https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/deep_cnn

To get a general idea of CNN, this article has a great description: https://medium.com/@ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-part-3-deep-learning-and-convolutional-neural-networks-f40359318721#.wztpajua3. 

Interface: We will use Bootstrap for the UI and Flask for the backend. We will deploy on AWS instance.
